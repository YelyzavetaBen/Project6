<h2>Goal</h2>
The goal of this project is to accurately and efficiently forecast air passenger traffic data by utilizing two powerful forecasting methods: Facebook's Prophet and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) with Fourier features. The project aims to compare and evaluate the performance of these two models, and provide insights into the trends and seasonality of the air passenger data. Additionally, the project will serve as a practical demonstration of how to apply these forecasting techniques to real-world data.


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on forecasting air passenger data using two powerful time series forecasting techniques: Prophet and ARIMA with Fourier features. Leveraging historical air passenger data, the primary objective is to develop accurate and reliable predictive models that can capture the underlying patterns and seasonality inherent in air travel demand.


<h2>Skills</h2>

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Advanced data visualization to represent complex relationships in the data.
- Model Development:
- Prophet: The Prophet forecasting tool, developed by Facebook, will be utilized to model the trend and seasonality in the air passenger data. Prophet is particularly well-suited for handling irregularly spaced time series data and capturing holiday effects and other seasonal patterns.
- ARIMA with Fourier Features: The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model augmented with Fourier features will be developed to account for the seasonality in the data. Fourier terms will be added to the model to capture periodic patterns and improve forecasting accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of both Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models will be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and forecast accuracy measures. This evaluation will provide insights into the effectiveness of each modeling approach in forecasting life expectancy.
- Forecasting and Interpretation: Using the developed models, future life expectancy trends will be forecasted for the desired time horizon. These forecasts will be interpreted to provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders involved in public health initiatives.

<h2>Results</h2>
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the application of two powerful forecasting methods, Prophet and ARIMA with Fourier features, to the air passenger traffic data. The data was preprocessed and explored to gain a better understanding of its characteristics, including trends and seasonality.

The Prophet model was found to be particularly effective for this dataset, with its ability to handle multiple seasonality and trends. The model was fine-tuned using appropriate hyperparameters and techniques, resulting in accurate and reliable forecasts.

The ARIMA model with Fourier features was also implemented and fit to the data. While the performance of this model was not as strong as the Prophet model, it still provided valuable insights into the autoregressive and moving average components of the time series.

Overall, this project highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate forecasting method for a given dataset, and the benefits of using multiple methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data. The project also provides a practical demonstration of how to apply these forecasting techniques to real-world data, and will be useful for anyone interested in time series analysis and forecasting.
